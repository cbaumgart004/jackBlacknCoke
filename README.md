The fabulous game where you can drink a cocktail and it has nothing to do with Jack Black
## Description


We set out to create a fun blackjack game that calls on the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/) to keep track of up to 6 decks in a shoe for a fun blackjack experience.  In addition, and in violation of every social casino norm, this game calls on the [Sunset and Sunrise Times API](https://sunrisesunset.io/api/) to give you real-time updates on whether it's day or night outside.
